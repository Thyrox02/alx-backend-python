# Unittests and Integration Tests                                                                   This project contains tasks for learning to write unittests and integration tests in Python 3.                                                        ## Required Modules

                                                  + [x] 0. **Parameterize a unit test**<br/>[test_utils.py](test_utils.py) contains a python module that meets the following requirements:                + Familiarize yourself with the `utils.access_nested_map` function and understand its purpose. Play with it in the Python console to make sure you understand.                                          + In this task you will write the first unit test for `utils.access_nested_map`.                    + Create a `TestAccessNestedMap` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.                      + Implement the `TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map` method to test that the method returns what it is supposed to.
